> Very Fast Simulated Anneeling global optimization of zero offset CRS parameters.

[This program is part of the Madagascar package! version 3.0.](https://github.com/ahay/src/tree/master/user/dirack)

This is a package with several C programs adapted to the Madagascar seismic processing package. The mains objective of
those programs is to extract the zero offset CRS parameters (RN, RNIP, BETA) 
a reflection data cube (seismic data organized in CMP x Offset X Time coordinates). 
These parameters can be used to fit the data with the non-hyperbolic CRS traveltime approximation.

[More information about the non-hyperbolic CRS](http://www.reproducibility.org/RSF/book/tccs/crs/paper_html/)

## CRS stacking method

The CRS stacking method use a CRS surface generated by a CRS traveltime approximation to stack the seismic data in the
neighborhood of a normal ray. The traveltime approximation can be determined with only the knowledge of three parameters
associated with the normal ray (RN, RNIP and BETA).

## Convergence result

The result expected before VFSA global optimization algorithm is the convergence of the approximated surface, generated with
the non-hyperbolic CRS traveltime approximation (midle), and the reflection surface extracted from the data (left).
The difference in the time between two surfaces is the approximation error (right). The CRS paramters (RN, RNIP and BETA)
that produced the minimum error will be the optimized ones.

## Development setup

You need to have the actual Madagascar package stable release installed on your computer. Please follow the
[Installing Madagascar page](http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Installation) in the official documentation.

## Installation

After Madagascar installing process, you need to install the programs of this repository in your local Madagascar users
directory. You can compile and install as any Madagascar program. 
Run 'scons' on your Madagascar repository to compile:

```shell
~$ scons
```

If you need a SConstruct to compile, use 
[this example](https://github.com/Dirack/vfsa/blob/master/SConstruct).

And install it on your local Madagascar installation:

```shell
~$ sudo scons install
```

If you have any doubt about this process, please reffer to the oficial documentation in 
[Adding_new_programs_to_Madagascar](http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Adding_new_programs_to_Madagascar)

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how that product can be used can be found in the 
[usage_examples directory](https://github.com/Dirack/vfsa/tree/master/usage_examples).

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Dirack/vfsa/wiki)._
