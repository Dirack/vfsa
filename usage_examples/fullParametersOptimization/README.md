#### Usage examples of sfvfsacrsnh for a set of (t0,m0) pairs

In this usage example we use the same gaussian reflector model as input and kirchhoff modeling. We use _sfvfsacrsnh_ to obtain the CRS parameters for a set of (t0,m0) pairs.

### How to run it?

* Run 'scons' in this directory (it may take some time):

```sh
~$ scons
```

#### Expected outcomes

**TODO**
